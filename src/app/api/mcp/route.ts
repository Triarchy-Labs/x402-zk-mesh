/**
 * MCP TOOL DISCOVERY — Gateway Capability Endpoint
 * 
 * Assimilated from: devloot-mcp-server (AgentFund / Arthur)
 * Pattern: server.tool("question_market", ...) onboarding discovery
 * 
 * Provides a machine-readable capability manifest so external AI agents
 * can discover what tools the x402 gateway offers via MCP protocol.
 * This is the "question_market" onboarding pattern mutated for our gateway.
